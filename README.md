# _o Carvalho_'s poor dotfiles

Updates VERY soon :)

## To-Do list

- [ ] Add more information on how I set my Fedora Workstation up
- [ ] Add resolution awareness and remove logs from [ffcompress](scripts/.local/bin/ffcompress)

## Notes on the welcome binary included in bashrc and scripts

The binary `welcome` is a small utility written I made in Go because shell was too slow for what I needed. I have no clue how to include it here somehow, so I'll link it instead: [welcome_shell](https://github.com/diogotavc/welcome_shell)

More updates coming its way, hopefully soon!

## Sway is no more!

This repository was previously centered around my Sway workflow. It served me well and helped me stay productive, even during exam season.

However, I've since migrated back to GNOME. While I enjoyed the tiling workflow of Sway, I found myself missing some aspects of a more traditional desktop environment.

As such, the Sway configuration files are no longer actively updated or in use. Feel free to browse [them](<https://github.com/diogotavc/dotfiles/tree/f11f4eddfbe1847590c26f32d208de3cfe66a949>) for inspiration, but please be aware that they may not be fully functional or compatible with the latest versions of the associated programs.

If you're interested in setting up a similar environment, I recommend checking out the documentation for Sway and the other programs listed in the dotfiles.

Thank you for visiting!
