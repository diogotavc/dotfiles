## Sway is no more!

This repository was previously centered around my Sway workflow. It served me well and helped me stay productive, even during exam season.

However, I've since migrated back to GNOME. While I enjoyed the tiling workflow of Sway, I found myself missing some aspects of a more traditional desktop environment.

As such, the Sway configuration files are no longer actively updated or in use. Feel free to browse [them](<https://github.com/diogotavc/dotfiles/tree/f11f4eddfbe1847590c26f32d208de3cfe66a949>) for inspiration, but please be aware that they may not be fully functional or compatible with the latest versions of the associated programs.

If you're interested in setting up a similar environment, I recommend checking out the documentation for Sway and the other programs listed in the dotfiles.

Thank you for visiting!
