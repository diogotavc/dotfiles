# _o Carvalho_'s poor dotfiles

## To-Do list

- [ ] Add more information on how I set my Fedora Workstation up
- [ ] Add resolution awareness and clean up the logs from [ffcompress](scripts/.local/bin/ffcompress)

## Notes on the welcome binary

The binary `welcome` is no longer included in my dotfiles, but you can still browse its source code at [welcome_shell](https://github.com/diogotavc/welcome_shell).
